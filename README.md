# DayZ-Mod-Updater
Script to update DayZ mods from the steam workshop

Currently this script is meant to be used together with [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/), it'll probably work with a normal DayZ server too. Let me know if something need to be change for that.

If you have any suggestions or bugs to report just create an issue here on GitHub.

Move the `mod-updater.py` file into your root directory of the server.  
**Don't forget to modify the script variables with your needs e.g. SteamCMD login**

Script execution: `python mod-updater.py`
